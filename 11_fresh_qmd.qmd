# Writing comments

Won't be able to see the below on render because they are comments.

```{=html}
<!-- This is a comment that will not appear in the render (but it does appear in the visual as bright green, do not worry about this).

We get this by doing ctrl + shift + c-->
```
<!-- hello -->

## Some other stuff

My favourite sum:

## Inserting some of our code from earlier
# Some weird stuff happens, such as warnings being printed (note how this can be avoided in the first line of the chunk).

```{r}
#| warning: false

# Writing data

library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
gapminder <- read.csv("data/gapminder_data.csv")

# Some plots
lifeExp_plot <- ggplot(gapminder, aes(year, lifeExp)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3, size = 0.5)

cont_plot <- lifeExp_plot +
  facet_wrap(vars(continent))

# Saving plots (if you do not specify a plot then it will save the most recent plot)
## There are a lot of issues with this, so good to specify width and height (6:4 works okay in this example, and creates a file of 240KB.)
ggsave("results/life_expectancy_by_continent.png", cont_plot, width = 6, height = 4)
ggsave("results/life_expectancy_by_continent.pdf", cont_plot, width = 6, height = 4)

cont_plot
```
